# Logistic-Regression
Code that performs Logistic regression using the gradient ascent algorithm.    
The following are each of the method's functions:    
q2_1: Trains the model for prediciting Ovarian cancer in a person. Uses 5-fold cross validation on the training set for selecting optimum values for the hyper-parameters.    
q2_2: Does forward and backward selection and then compares both of the model's performances on the test set.    
q3_3: Plots ROC and Precision-Recall curves for both the forward and backward selection models.
